Additional Features: 1. Animation – I added two new visual elements to the aliens: a walking animation and an explosion animation. Firstly, I made the walking animation by creating a method that switches between frames 0 and 1 of the aliens called _walkAliens. I called this function every time the aliens took a step, producing the illusion of movement. Secondly, I made the explosion animation using a coroutine similar to the one I utilized to create the ship’s death animation. The main difference was this time I needed to create two new attributes _index1 and _index2 to store the indices of the alien hit by the bolt, so I could set the correct alien to None once the animation was done. 2. Sounds – I added sounds to the ship’s death animation, the ship’s bolts, and the alien’s explosion animation. Additionally, I provided the player with the option to mute and unmute all sounds by pressing the key “m”. I accomplished this by first creating a new attribute called _sounds to store all the sound objects I will be using in a list. Then I created a function called _muteSounds that switches the volume on and off when the player presses the “m” key. Next, I used the play method on different objects in _sounds throughout my code to produce the appropriate sounds. Lastly, I provided variety by making the sound of the ship exploding become increasingly explosive each time the player is killed.
